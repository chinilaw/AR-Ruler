# AR-Ruler
An exercise I learned in Udemy that creates an Augmented reality of measuring objects by tapping from one point to another. The measurement is converted from centimeters to inches and is displayed still through AR

What I Learned
- Visualizing the plane surface by way of showing feature points
- Capturing touch of the user and leaving a red dot to mark territory
